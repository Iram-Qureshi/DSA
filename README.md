## Introduction

This repository contains various implementations of classic data structures and algorithms in C++. Each implementation includes detailed explanations, time and space complexity analyses, and example use cases. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, this repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations to enhance your understanding of DSA concepts.

## Data Structures

1. **Linked List**: Implementations of singly linked list, doubly linked list, and circular linked list.
2. **Stack**: Implementation of a stack data structure with operations like push, pop, and peek.
3. **Queue**: Implementation of a queue data structure with enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations.
4. **Binary Tree**: Implementation of binary tree data structure with traversal algorithms.
5. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Implementation of BST with operations like insert, delete, and search.
6. **Heap**: Implementation of min heap and max heap data structures.
7. **Hash Table**: Implementation of hash table using separate chaining or open addressing.
8. **Graph**: Implementation of graph data structure with various graph algorithms.

## Algorithms

1. **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementations of popular sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, and heap sort.
2. **Searching Algorithms**: Implementations of linear search, binary search, and other search algorithms.
